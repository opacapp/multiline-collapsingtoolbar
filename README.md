# multiline-collapsingtoolbar [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/opacapp/libs/multiline-collapsingtoolbar/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/opacapp/libs/multiline-collapsingtoolbar/_latestVersion)
_multiline-collapsingtoolbar_ is a replacement for `CollapsingToolbarLayout` from the [Android
Design Support Library](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_support/tree/master/design)
which can deal with multiline titles (with a customizable maximum number of lines) in the
expanded state. When collapsing the toolbar,  the lower lines of the title fade away to leave
only the top line visible.

## Information about compatibility with AndroidX

We are currently not planning to update this library for support of the Android Support Library version 28 or the new AndroidX libraries, as has been discussed in [#62](https://github.com/opacapp/multiline-collapsingtoolbar/issues/62) and other places. Instead, we are trying to get our modifications merged into the official Material Components Android library. Please see [the PR](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/pull/413) for more details.

## Example
Here you can see the library in action in the included demo app:

## Installation

If you are using Gradle and the JCenter Maven Repository, installing the library is as simple as
adding a new dependency statement.

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'net.opacapp:multiline-collapsingtoolbar:28.0.0'
}
```

The current version 28.0.0 of the library is based on the code and tested with the **Design Support
Library version 28.0.0**.
We'll try to keep up to date with new support library versions as soon as possible, but please **do not expect this
library to run with support versions other than that.**

## Usage
The library's public API is nearly identical to the version from the support library, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement. We only added a `maxLines` attribute and corresponding getter and setter functions to the `CollapsingToolbarLayout` to make it possible to change the maximum number of lines, which is set to 3 by default.

As the Design Support Library, it should be compatible with API 14 (Android 4.0) and above.

XML layout example:
```xml
<android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout
        android:layout_height="192dp"
        android:layout_width="match_parent">
    <net.opacapp.multilinecollapsingtoolbar.CollapsingToolbarLayout
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            app:layout_scrollFlags="scroll|exitUntilCollapsed"
            app:maxLines="3">
        <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar
                android:layout_height="?attr/actionBarSize"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                app:layout_collapseMode="pin"/>
    </net.opacapp.multilinecollapsingtoolbar.CollapsingToolbarLayout>
</android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout>
```

You can find a simple demo application in the `demo` module.

## Implementation details
Most of the code is copied from the original Support Library classes, the only changes (apart from the package name, imports and automatic code reformatting) are in the `CollapsingTextHelper` and `CollapsingToolbarLayout` classes. The changes there are marked with comments.
